RSocket interface demo
==========================================

The Spring Framework lets you define an RSocket service as a Java interface with annotated methods for RSocket exchanges. 
You can then generate a proxy that implements this interface and performs the exchanges. 
This helps to simplify RSocket remote access by wrapping the use of the underlying RSocketRequester.
